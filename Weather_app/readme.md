# Weather App Project

This project guides you through building a weather application that fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays it on a user-friendly interface. You'll gain hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while incorporating an external API to enhance your web development skills.

## Objectives

- Understand the concept of weather APIs and their applications.
- Build a basic weather app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Fetch weather data from an external API (OpenWeatherMap).
- Manipulate JSON data retrieved from the API.
- Update the user interface dynamically based on fetched data.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of HTML structure.
- Familiarity with CSS fundamentals for styling.
- No prior JavaScript experience is required, but a willingness to learn is essential!

## Tools and Technologies

- Text editor or code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text)
- Web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox)
- OpenWeatherMap account (Free tier available for personal use) [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api)

## Project Outline

The project is divided into the following sections:

### Introduction and Setting Up:

- Introduction to weather APIs and their benefits.
- Project overview and the technologies involved (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
- Choosing and obtaining an API key from OpenWeatherMap.

### Building the User Interface (HTML & CSS):

- Creating the basic HTML structure for the app layout (header, search bar, weather display).
- Styling the app's visual appearance using CSS (fonts, colors, responsiveness).

### Fetching Data and Updating UI (JavaScript):

- Fetching weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API using JavaScript's fetch API.
- Parsing the JSON response data to extract relevant weather information (temperature, description, etc.).
- Dynamically updating the HTML elements in the UI with the retrieved weather data.
